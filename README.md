# ImageClef-Lifelog-2020
the subtask LifeLog Retrieval of the international ImageCLef competition offers a challenge that requires building an Image retrieval system based on textual queries.
So, in this case, this kind of system requires good treatment of the input textual queries with different Word Embedding techniques which are FastText, Word2Vec, and Glove.
# Code Description
In this repository, you find two notebooks the first presents the implementation of three-word Embedding models (FastText, Word2Vec, Glove) that I built from scratch. The second Notebook presents the Matching between textual queries and image description.
